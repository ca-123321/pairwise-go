Make todo more organized, move this junk into randomthoughts.txt or w/e

Figure out what the card-making site wants as far as "individual card.pdf" vs "whole deck on separate pages.pdf"
Figure out dimensions of cards
Refresh TeX, and TikZ
Figure out how create 31 dummy "symbols" and how big they should be, for order 5 (6 obj/card, 31 obj, 31 cards)
Get back into git flow, maybe just start from scratch with some github 
-- it's a personal project, not a job, don't stress too much about doing it perfect for public view

Decide on decks.

Can use any numbers if I think about subtraction too. How to evenly divide this stuff though?
(0,3) (3,0) 
(1,2) (2,1) 
(4,-1) but not (-1,4) 
(5,-2) but not (-2,5)

How am I going to turn something like (0,3) or (5,-2) into "0+3" or "5-2"
Might just be quicker to do that part by hand than think about some kind of scheme that parses and formats
